# Capstone_Movie_Recommendation
This is a capstone project to predict the movie rating using movie recommendation algorithms in R.


For this project, I will be creating a movie recommendation system using the MovieLens dataset. One can find the [entire latest MovieLens dataset here](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/latest/). Only the 10M version of the MovieLens dataset will be used to make the computation a little easier <https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/10m/>. 


I will be creating a recommendation system using all the tools that I have learned throughout the courses in the professional data science course series (<https://online-learning.harvard.edu/series/professional-certificate-data-science>). We will use the 10M version of the MovieLens dataset to make the computation a little easier.
